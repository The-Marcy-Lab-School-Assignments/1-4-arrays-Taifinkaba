# Question

Look at the following code:

```js
let name = "mike";
const changeName = (nameToChange) => {
  nameToChange = "tom";
};
changeName(name);
console.log(name);

const favoriteLocations = ["New York City", "Jersey City"];
const addBostonToFavorites = (locations) => {
  locations.unshift("Boston");
};
addBostonToFavorites(favoriteLocations);
console.log(favoriteLocations);
```

Why was `favoriteLocations` changed, but `name` was not?

# Answer
`favoriteLocations` changed because it uses an array which is `pass by reference` while `name` follows a different  `pass by value` function.

Yup! You forgot the word value when describing the other function so make sure you are always re-reading your response!
